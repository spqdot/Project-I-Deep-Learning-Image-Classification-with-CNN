## 📋 About

This project implements an end-to-end **animal image classification system** trained on the Animals-10 dataset. It showcases the evolution of deep learning models, starting from basic architectures to advanced transfer learning, ultimately achieving **96.90% test accuracy** using MobileNetV3Large.

### Model Development Journey

#### 🔵 Model 1 - Baseline CNN
- **Architecture**: 2 Conv layers + 1 MaxPooling + Dense
- **Training Accuracy**: 55.80%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 51.57%
- **Test Accuracy**: 54.35%
- **Status**: Low Capacity
- **Learning**: Simple baseline that demonstrated limited feature extraction capability. Showed need for deeper networks and better architecture design.

#### 🟢 Model 2 - Improved CNN (Best Custom Model)
- **Architecture**: 4 Conv layers + 2 MaxPooling layers
- **Training Accuracy**: 69.69%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 66.62%
- **Test Accuracy**: 68.07%
- **Status**: Good Generalization ✅
- **Learning**: Deeper architecture extracted richer features. Best performing custom CNN with consistent performance across train/val/test sets. Became baseline for subsequent experiments.

#### 🟡 Model 3 - CNN with Dropout
- **Architecture**: Model 2 + Dropout layers
- **Training Accuracy**: 61.82%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 54.74%
- **Test Accuracy**: 62.95%
- **Status**: Slight Overfitting
- **Learning**: Dropout helped reduce overfitting but also reduced model capacity. Lower accuracy than Model 2, showing too much regularization can hurt performance.

#### 🟠 Model 4 - BatchNorm + Dropout (96×96 Images)
- **Architecture**: BatchNorm + Dropout with reduced image size
- **Training Accuracy**: N/A
- **Validation Accuracy**: Very Low
- **Test Accuracy**: 18.72%
- **Status**: Severe Underfitting ❌
- **Learning**: Reducing image size from 128×128 to 96×96 removed critical visual information. Poor results demonstrated importance of adequate input resolution for feature preservation.

#### 🟣 Model 5 - Global Average Pooling Experiment
- **Architecture**: 4 Conv + 2 MaxPooling + BatchNorm + Dropout + Global Average Pooling
- **Training Accuracy**: 62.44%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 51.57%
- **Test Accuracy**: 51.57%
- **Status**: Overfitting
- **Learning**: Global Average Pooling removed spatial details and over-simplified the model. Large gap between training and validation accuracy (11%) showed poor generalization.

#### 🔴 Model 6 - BatchNorm + Flatten Strategy
- **Architecture**: 4 Conv + 2 MaxPooling + BatchNorm + Flatten
- **Training Accuracy**: 68.24%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 59.85%
- **Test Accuracy**: 62.11%
- **Status**: Moderate Overfitting
- **Learning**: Batch Normalization improved training stability and regularization. Model performed better than Models 3-5 but still showed 8.4% gap between training and validation. Early stopping was necessary to prevent further degradation after Epoch 14.

#### 🟤 Model 7 - Deeper CNN
- **Architecture**: 6 Conv layers + 3 MaxPooling layers + Flatten + Dense(256) + Dropout
- **Training Accuracy**: 68.12%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 66.12%
- **Test Accuracy**: 66.12%
- **Status**: Good Generalization ✅
- **Learning**: Even deeper architecture maintained good generalization with minimal gap between training and validation (2%). Matched Model 2 performance, showing deeper networks don't always improve custom CNNs without transfer learning.

#### 🔵 Model 8 - ResNet50 Transfer Learning
- **Architecture**: ResNet50 (pre-trained on ImageNet, not properly fine-tuned)
- **Training Accuracy**: 30.84%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 37.89%
- **Test Accuracy**: 37.89%
- **Status**: Severe Underfitting ❌
- **Learning**: First transfer learning attempt failed due to insufficient fine-tuning strategy. Showed that simply using pre-trained models without proper optimization doesn't guarantee success. Low learning rate and frozen base layers prevented effective learning.

#### 🏆 Model 9 - BEST: MobileNetV3Large with Transfer Learning ⭐
- **Architecture**: MobileNetV3Large (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Training Accuracy**: 93.27%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 96.84%

  - ✅ 28.55% improvement over best custom model (Model 2: 68.07%)
  - ✅ Validation accuracy > Test accuracy (96.84% vs 96.90%) - excellent sign
  - ✅ Minimal gap between training and validation (3.57%)
  - ✅ Faster inference time than custom CNNs
  - ✅ Mobile-friendly lightweight architecture
  - ✅ Per-class accuracy 93-98% for all animals
